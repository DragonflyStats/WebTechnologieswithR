ids A vector of IDs to lookup, should be Strings but numbers are accepted
... Optional </code></pre> #### Argument to be passed to GET (or POST, see ### Details)
### Details
Ideally a POST request would be used for lookup_statuses, however currently there is a problem
(issue 78 on github) and GET is used.
Value
For showStatus, an object of class status
For lookup_statuses, a list of status objects. Note that these will not be in the same order as the
ids argument and that any id which could not be retrieved will not be present.
