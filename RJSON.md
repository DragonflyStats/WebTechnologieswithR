package rjson
import "launchpad.net/rjson"

Package rjson implements a backwardly compatible version of JSON with the aim of making it easier for humans to read and write.

The data model is exactly that of JSON's and this package implements all the marshalling and unmarshalling operations supported by the standard library's json package.
